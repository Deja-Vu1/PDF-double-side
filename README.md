# Welcome to PDF-double-side!

Hi! I'm 15. I have a old printer so I can't print double-sided outs. The goal of this project is for anyone with an old printer to be able to double-sided printing.


# How

To better understand how the project works, I suggest you visit this site: https://www.instructables.com/Doubled-Sided-Printing-at-Home/

## Setup

First and Last step - Install requirements.txt.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

You can run **"main.py"** from PDF-double-side/UI/ folder. 

## How is it working
The pdf files you put in the PDF-double-side/Sources folder will be observable when you run the program. Each pdf document you drag from left to right in the program is inserted in order and made ready for double-sided printing.
